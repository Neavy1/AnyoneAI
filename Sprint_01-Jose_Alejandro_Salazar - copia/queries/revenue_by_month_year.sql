-- TODO: This query will return a table with the revenue by month and year. It
-- will have different columns: month_no, with the month numbers going from 01
-- to 12; month, with the 3 first letters of each month (e.g. Jan, Feb);
-- Year2016, with the revenue per month of 2016 (0.00 if it doesn't exist);
-- Year2017, with the revenue per month of 2017 (0.00 if it doesn't exist) and
-- Year2018, with the revenue per month of 2018 (0.00 if it doesn't exist).
